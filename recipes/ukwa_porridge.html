    <h3>How to make Ukwa Porridge</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 1: </strong>Pick the breadfruit seeds (Ukwa) to remove the chaff
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2: </strong>Prepare the akaun by pounding to a fine powder. Pour the akaun powder into &half cup of water and 
            stir thoroughly to dissolve - set aside. Potash is used in the preparation of this meal to cut down the cooking time. This is because, 
            breadfruit (ukwa) takes a very long time to soften and the addition of potash which acts as a tenderizer to soften the ukwa 
            faster. If you are not as hungry as me, you could skip the addition of potash hehehe :).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 3: </strong>Wash severally to remove dirt and sand and place in a medium sized pot. Add 3 cups of water (just enough to cover 
            the content of the pot) and leave to boil for 30mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 4: </strong>Stir the potash and water mixture once more and pour into the boiling pot of Ukwa making sure you don't pour in the 
            residue which should be discarded.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 5: </strong>Add some more water just enough to cover the ukwa in the pot if needed and leave to boil and soften for another 10 mins. 
            At this stage, add the chopped onion, scotch bonnet, dried prawns "okporo" (with the head removed), salt to taste and seasoning cubes - Leave to
             boil for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 6: </strong>Add the crayfish and palmoil - stir and leave to boil together till the liquid in the pot evaporates.
